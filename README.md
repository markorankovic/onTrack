# Introduction
The aim of onTrack is to help people who struggle to focus on a given task and sometimes also lose track of things they were supposed to do. onTrack monitors the user's focus through routinely communications between the app and the user with minimal disruptions to the user's activity. This takes place by specifying the task the user is focused on and the interval at which the app which fire a notification to check if the user is still focused on the task. However, simply displaying notifications to user can eventually serve little to no purpose if the user gets used to seeing the same notification. To overcome this issue the app can use Reinforcements for the notifications designed to obtain responses from the user in such a way that the user would have to be conscious about the task in order to deliver a valid response. Failure to do so will result in the alarm setting off to which the user would have to go back on the app and reset/stop the timer.

# Usage
1. Open the app and you should see the following screen.

2. Where it says "Your Objective", replace that with the title of your task.
3. The slider below is for you to adjust how often you want the notification to fire in minutes. By default it is 30s.
4. Before you start the timer by pressing the play button, check the settings by pressing the ⚙️ button.
5. Adjust the settings (see Settings) as needed
6. You're ready to get onTrack!

## Notifications
### Reinforcements
Reinforcements offer a variety of UIs on the notifications aimed to reinforce the user's awareness of the task by demanding certain responses that require the user's attention.
#### Standard

The Standard reinforcement features a notification which asks the user if they're focusing with their task displayed and the user must respond by clicking on the Yes button.
#### Type out the task
(Image)
This reinforcement requires that the user types out the task they're supposed to do and then press the submit button.
#### Press the right yes
(Image)
Like the Standard reinforcement, the user is required to press the Yes button, only in this case there is a No button present. Often one would expect the Yes button to be located on the left hand side with the No button on the right hand side, however that is not necessarily the case as shown below.

The idea behind this reinforcement is that the user does not press the Yes button in the same location of the screen every time with hopes that the user will be wary about the notification and that way the task.
#### What you gonna do now

What you gonna now, the moment the notification is gone? Not the ultimate task you have set, but the exact action you will take right at the moment?
The idea here is to make the user think about smaller milestones for reaching the objective they've set. The next time this notification fires, it will display the previous response made by the user. 
## Sound
### Alarm Sounds
Here you can choose which alarm sound will play on failure to respond to the notification within 10 seconds. The default sound is Wake Up which is an wake-up alarm sound effect, the other two is Evacuation featuring a nuclear warning alarm sound effect and the Police siren. Below is the Test button allowing you to test out the selected alarm sound.
